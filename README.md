## UX Writing | Techincal Writing 
**[Web Copy & Layout Design](assets/files/web-copy-layout.pdf)**
> The priority at CreateASoft was to freshen up the website by de-cluttering and simplifying the layout. The home page in particular needed to be a brief but comprehensive overview of our company's offerings. This page outlines our products and services in plain language, and gives visitors an easy starting step into the rest of the website.

**[Developer Guide](assets/files/developer-guide.pdf)**
> In-house developers need to know how our tools work and how to use them. Developer guides, written in plain language and organized logically, make onboarding easy and standardize development procedures across the department.
  
**[Installation Guide](assets/files/installation-guide.pdf)**
> Customer-facing installation guides like this one are how we support our clients as they adopt our products. Good documentation builds trust because it shows you understand your audience, and successful product adoption leads to fewer headaches for internal support teams.

**[White Paper](assets/files/white-paper.pdf)**
> Intra-industry providers need to set themselves apart, and white papers are an opportunity to showcase our solution, why it's different, and how it helps the organizations who use it. 

## Content Design

**[Technical Content Layout](assets/files/technical-content-layout.pdf)**
> At CreateASoft, engaging customers with clear, thorough, and precise overviews of our products is essential. Info graphics like this one help start the conversation with curious parties by providing simple explanations of high-level technical software functions. We saw that leads increased and that potential clients were more engaged during the early stages of the enterprise sales process.

**[PowerPoint Redesign](assets/files/presentation-redesign.pdf)**
> Sales staff wondered why leads were ghosting them. By editing the tone and design of our introductory presentation, we were able to simplify our delivery, build an ethos with prospective clients, focusing less on how the software works and more on how it would help them. 

**[Software Price List](assets/files/software-price-list.pdf)**
> A customer-facing overview of software solution packages.
